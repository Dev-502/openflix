In browser torrent streaming open source netflix clone

## Todo
* ~~Implement themoviedb.org to search & fetch film data~~
* ~~Implement yts.re/api to fetch torrent data~~
* Implement webtorrent to accomplish in-browser torrent streaming
  * An alternative would be to implent this as a chrome extension, but this would only work in Chrome :(
* Implement yifysubtitles.com to fetch subs

## Wishlist
* On-the-fly video/audio transcoding
  * Would be great, but I think it might be very slow
